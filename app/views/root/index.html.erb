		<h2>Understanding Anxiety</h2>
			<div class= "col-sm-4">
				<h3>When anxiety becomes panic</h3>
				<p>Everyone experiences anxiety. Whether because of a big exam or speech, these anxious feelings typically pass when the source of stress does. However, when these symptoms occur without any real danger, thatâ€™s when our anxiety elevates to panic.</p>
			</div>
			<div class= "col-sm-4">
				<h3>Natural Instinct</h3>
				<p>It's natural to experience anxiety. Our bodies interpret all threats as predators. When we experience anxiety our bodies react accordingly - sweating increases, breathing and heart rate speed up, etc. This response has kept us alive since the dawn of man.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "col-sm-4">
				<h3>How panic works</h3>
				<p>Once we show symptoms of anxiety, the worst thing we can do is stress because of it. The fear of these symptoms feeds panic and actually increases our physical symptoms. But unmasking this fear is the first step towards recovery.</p>
